## use constrained SDP to solve OLS

# constrain std params to physical consistent space to only achieve physical consistent parameters

## other forms of OLS

# use previously known CAD parameters to identify parameter error, estimates parameters closer to

# covariance estimation can be off (also assumes that error is zero mean and normal

# mostly not improving results
