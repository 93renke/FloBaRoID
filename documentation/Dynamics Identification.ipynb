    "### Standard and Base Parameters\n",
    "The parameters $x$ are called the standard parameters as they occur in the normal dynamics equations. The rank of the regressor is usually smaller than its number of columns, i.e. some columns are linearly dependent (matrix is rank deficient). There are therefore infinite solutions for the equations of which only some are physically consistent and meaningful (see below) because the matrix is singular.\n",
    "Before inverting the equation to retrieve the minimum identifiable parameters (base or identifiable parameters), we need to reduce the regressor $Y$'s columns to the linearly independent one, using an algorithm given by Gautier, 1990, using SVD or QR or using closed form rules (Khalil). That way, some base parameters that are not significant are removed and some will be linear combinations of two or more standard parameters, that were linearly dependent. The base parameters are linearly independent but the choice is not unique (there are multiple possibilities of combining the columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "The regressor for the base parameters can be retrieved from the SVD, where the first $r = \\text{rank}(Y_\\text{std})$ columns of V are the basis vectors of the identifiable subspace. There is computeFloatingBaseIdentifiableSubspace() in iDynTree which calculates this orthogonal basis $B$ of the identifiable parameters subspace. It can be used to project from the standard regressor to the base regressor, i.e. $Y_\\text{base} = Y_\\text{std}B$ (See Traversaro, 2015, p.3).\n",
    "Similar the first $r$ colimns from matrix Q of the QR decomposition of $Y_\\text{std}$ represent an orthonormal basis of the column space of $Y_\\text{base}$. In order to not be dependent on incomplete data, a stacked regressor matrix can also be generated with random $q, \\dot{q}, \\dot{q}$, in turn giving the structural linear dependencies that is independent from the trajectory. For computational efficiency, the random regressors can also be added on top of each other (forgot the exakt reason why this works - Traversaro, unpublished?).\n",
    "Other methods get the linear relationship between removed columns and remaining by QR decomposition or the SVD with a permutation matrix (see Gautier, 1990), the reduced row echelon form (Klodmann, 2015) or explicit symbolic rules (Khalil, 19?).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinary least squares can be improved by weighting with the inverse of the standard deviation of the error calculated with the ordinary LS (Gautier, 2013, p.1431). That way, parameters with smaller errors deviation are given higher priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain standard parameters for e.g. simulation models or modifying the URDF file, after identifying the base parameters $\\tilde{x}_\\text{base}$, they can be projected back to the standard basis using the same projection matrix $B$, obtaining a non-unique $\\tilde{x}$. In case $B$ is orthonormal, $\\tilde{x}_\\text{std} = B^T \\tilde{x}_\\text{base}$ (otherwise, use pinv). This way, the parameters are however not necessarily physically meaningful (also called physical consistent) in which case stability assumptions for certain model based controllers or simulation will fail. Useful torque prediction can however be done already.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard parameters are called physical consistent if masses are striclty positive, the inertia matrix is positive definite (i.e. for any non-zero real vector $z$: ${\\displaystyle z^{\\mathrm {T} }Mz}$) and the center of mass is located inside of the link segment. The moments of inertia need to respect the triangle inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Various methods have been proposed to obtain better parameters and to improve the consistency. While improving the identification itself (less noise or be closer to gaussian distribution, obtain more data, excite ideal trajectories, select data to improve condition number, etc.) can likely improve the base parameter accuracy, there is however no unique mapping back to the standard parameters. There is rather an affine subspace of the standard solution vector space $V_\\text{base} \\subset \\mathbb{R}^{10*n_\\text{links}}$ that includes all solutions that project to the same base identified parameters, i.e. $V_\\text{base} = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{10*n_\\text{links}} \\,|\\, Bx = \\tilde{x}_\\text{base}\\}$. The affine subspace of all standard solutions that are physically consistent might be intersecting with $V_\\text{base}$ in which case $\\tilde{x}_\\text{base}$ is called physically consistent.\n",

    "### Essential Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The base parameters might still have elements that are (get identified as?) almost zero and therefore don't contribute much to the dynamics calculations. Possibly because they have not been excited well in the experiment that was measured. They can therefore be cancelled (params and regressor columns deleted) to retrieve a smaller model and set of parameters called the essential parameters (Gautier, there is also another definition for essential parameters in Sheu, 1991). The residual error will not grow a bit as the model will be expressed with fewer parameters and equations but should stay small.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential base parameters can be determined using the relative standard deviation of the identifed parameter vector, using standard deviation of the error of the estimated torques (See Gautier, 2013). Iteratively, the parameter with the largest relative std dev will be cancelled and the estimation repeated. This is done until a ratio of min and max relative std dev on the parameters is reached that is \"between 30 and 20\". That way, the similarity of estimation \"certainty\" of the remaining parameters is increased. The error itself is not looked at. Other criteria for stopping the model reduction because of error are the F-statistic (Janot 2014) or the lack-of-fit error (based on mean least squares) but these measures assume that the error is normal distributed which is not always the case so that these statistic tests can be calculated. Janot recommends improving measurements, filtering etc. Also, it is unclear (to me) how these measures are related to amount of samples selected, they seem to change a lot on the same data when e.g. only every other sample is selected.\n",
    "Alternatively, looking at the percentual error of the estimation in relation to the maximal torque ranges of each joint or the maximum measured torque ranges allows stopping before the prediction error gets too large (torque prediction should ultimately still be good, even if the parameters are not estimated close to the actual values).\n",
    "However, it is possible that the estimation of the parameters is bad if too few paramters are removed (?).\n",
    "\n",
    "The torque error $\\rho$ in $(4)$ includes measurement error, error due to unmodelled effects (linear and non-linear) and the error from model reduction. Before reduction, only the modelling error $\\rho_j$ of sample $j$ can be determined (the real torques are not known) as the mean of the difference of measured torques $\\tau_i$ and the corresponding estimated torques $\\hat{\\tau_i}$ of joint $i$:\n",

    "$$ \\frac{\\text{mse}}{\\text{mean}(\\text{torqranges})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the QR decomposition or permutation matrices for determining which std parameters are regrouped into the base parameters, it is known which of the standard parameters belong to each of the base parameters. Having determined the indices of the essential parameters within the base parameters, and knowing the indices of the base parameters within the standard parameters, the essential parameters within the standard parameters can also be determined.\n",
    "Each base parameter $b$ can correspond to a linear combination of $n$ standard parameters $a_n$ $k_1a_1+k_2a_2+...+k_na_n$. Each of the $a_n$ is assumed to be essential if $b$ is essential (to be inclusive; some of them can have no influence). The paper is not clear about how the essential parameter within the standard vector is determined, experiments suggest that using the dependent std columns of each base essential parameter improve the results. The weighting of these parameters is non-trivial (see code). The final estimation of the essential parameter vector is described in Gautier, 2013 and boils down to\n",

    "\n",
    "Using parameters from the CAD model, it is possible to determine standard parameters that are close to the a priori knowledge (Gautier, 2013, p.1432). The claim is that if the CAD values are physical consistent (and well chosen), the determined values are still optimal with regard to error norms (other methods are usually increasing the residual error). It turns out however that this is not necessarily true, only if the parameters change very little. There are usually fewer links though that are physically inconsistent and a combination with other methods might be worth a try.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $x^\\text{ref}_\\text{std}$ be the a priori CAD parameter vector and $\\tau^\\text{ref}$ be the torques estimated with these parameters by $\\tau^\\text{ref} = Y_\\text{std}x^\\text{ref}_\\text{std}$.\n",

    "### Convex optimization with constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the obtained parameters minimize the error norm but otherwise have no constraints, the base parameters might be very close to the \"real\" ones but also can vary depending on ill-condition and noise. The resulting standard parameters will be far off the \"real\" ones even if the base parameters are estimated perfectly (as seen in simulation). The non-unique transformation back onto the standard solution space will often result in physically inconsistent parameters.\n",

    "It is possible to solve the OLS problem at the same time as the constraints with these formulations (e.g. SDP) but then the constraints have to be formulated in terms of the base parameters (Sousa, 2014). This has the advantage over constraining after obtaining a set of base parameters that it does not increase the residual error again. It could be worth checking the possibility to directly identify the standard parameters (Gautier, 2013) using SDP and use the direct constraints.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Retrieving torque measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The torque measurements should measure the deflection between link $i$ and child link $i+1$. For the position, velocity and acceleration, it is likely necessary to differentiate the velocity and possibly also the position depending on what measurements are available. Since differentiation has the effect of high-pass filtering and therefore adding new noise, the data can be low-pass filtered (e.g. with an appropriately designed butterworth filter). Even with butterworth, this can introduce phase-shift. Another option is to assume a curve shape model,\n",
    "fit it to a few data points and differentiate it analytically, it is also possible to use simple median filtering or RANSAC for additional elimation of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often done in previous work to use multiple experimental setups with separate body parts (going up the chain) while fixating the rest of the body to improve the estimation accuracy. For the iCub, the arms were \"cut\" at the position of the 6 DOF F/T sensors so that the measurement gives the contact forces for a fixed base scenario. The limbs should move with a standardized trajectory excitation that highlights all the influencing columns and has sufficient velocities, accelerations and forces appearing. The dynamic equations don't include friction or other non-linear effects. We can get the Jacobian(s) from iDynTree.\n",

    "## Joint Excitation\n",
    "\n",
    "A good estimation should yield physically consistent parameters and only produce small prediction errors (measured torques and simulated torques) with those estimated parameters.\n",
    "Siciliano recommends sufficiently rich trajectories that should however not excert unmodelled dynamic effects like elasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to get meaningful sample data that allows good estimation, trajectories can be generated by optimization of e.g. the prediction error or the condition number of the regressor matrix.\n",
    "Swevers, Gensemann (1997) use Fourier series on all joints to generate periodic excitation and use a common pulsation (i.e. frequency) so the excitation as a whole also stays periodic (multiples of the base frequency?). This way it is said to be easier to get time series measurements because averaging can be done to reduce noise, noise can be estimated and velocities and accelerations can be calculated analytically using the FFT to get near noise-free values. The joint angles for the $i$-th of $n$ joints are given by $N$ coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ q_i(t) = \\sum_{l=1}^{N_i} \\frac{a_l^i}{\\omega_f l} \\text{sin}(\\omega_f lt)- \\frac{b_l^i}{\\omega_f l} \\text{cos}(\\omega_f lt) + q_{i0}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore parameterized by the Fourier coefficients $a_l^i$ (amplitude of sin), $b_l^i$ (amplitude of cos) and $q_i0$ (offset on the position trajectory) for each term $l$ of each joint $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finding the right parameters is then an optimization problem to get ideal trajectories.\n",
    "The \"only correct\" criterion for experimentation design is the covariance matrix of the estimated model parameters which when using their maximum-likelyhood estimation is equal to $(F^t \\Sigma^{-1}F)^{-1}$ with $F$ the condition number. Optimization takes the model constraints into account, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ting, et. al (2006) describe a method based on Bayesian estimation that automatically detects noise and in a post-processing step, projects the estimate within consistency constraints (positive inertia values and parallel axis theorem). Higher measurement accuracy is claimed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ding, et. al. (2015) use an \"artificial bee\" algorithm to find the parameters for the fourier series parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "All methods optimize on minimum error of the identification trajectories, so parameters predict trajectories best that are similar or equal to those trajectories because only some links are exciting some of the parameters. Using the essential parameter approach, this results in only the most likely parameters being changed from the a priori values that are relevant for this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may become beneficiary to use specific optimized excitation trajectory experiments initially to have get a well identified general model but nevertheless, have task specific identification during the robot lifetime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating trajectories, samples from normal movement data of existing behaviors can be selected. The criterion for adding new data to the existing dataset or not is still to be determined but could be similar to existing optimization cirteria.\n",
    "Venture, et. al (2009) select data from an existing dataset to identify and calculate the condition number for sub-matrices of the regressor (select certain columns with all rows) to get information about which links are excerted.\n",
    "The final regressor is put together in such a way that all columns have low values. "
