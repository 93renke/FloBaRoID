For more details on the inertial parameters vector, check https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01137215/document\".\n",

For Walk-Man, the contact forces with the ground at the feet can be measured. For fixed base dynamics, the only force is coming through the constrained base link (for which the Jacobian is $J = [I \\quad 0]$ and the contact forces vanish).\n",

    "\n",
    "Before doing the inversion, we need to reduce the standard parameters to the actually identifiable base parameters by reducing $Y$ to the linearly independent columns, e.g. using Gautier algorithm, SVD or QR. Otherwise the pseudoinverse least squares approximation will be inaccurate. If $Y$ is not of full rank (i.e. columns not reduced), a damped least-squares method is recommended by Siciliano, et al (p.282). There is computeFloatingBaseIdentifiableSubspace() in iDynTree. The resulting basis $B$ of the base parameter subspace can be used to project from the standard regressor to the base regressor, i.e. $Y_\\text{base} = Y_\\text{std}B$.\n",
    "After obtaining the base parameters $\\tilde{x}$, we need to project them back to the standard basis in order to use them for e.g. simulation models or modifying the URDF file. When using a symbolic regressor, both can stay in the base subspace for e.g. torque prediction.\n",
    "Using the transpose of $B$ (transpose is here equal to pseudoinverse because the columns are already linearly independent), we can calculate $x_\\text{std} = B^T x_\\text{base}$.\n",
    "This way, an estimation of mean values is achieved to get the unknown distribution of one column to multiple ones.\n",
    "In any case, those are the columns that ideally don't have an impact to the result anyway (or a very small one).\n",
    "\n",
    "The inversion assumes that the equations are linear in the unknown parameters. This is however only true for Recursive Newton-Euler if the parameters are given . The inertia values/tensors need to be given in relation to the link frame (URDF uses relative to the COM). The COM needs to be given as first moment of mass. See also Khosla, 1985."

    "## Retrieving torque measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The torque measurements should measure the deflection between link $i$ and child link $i+1$. For the position, velocity and acceleration, it is likely necessary to differentiate the velocity and possibly also the position depending on what measurements are available. Since differentiation has the effect of high-pass filtering and therefore adding new noise, the data can be low-pass filtered (e.g. with an appropriately designed butterworth filter). This however can introduce phase-shift. Another option is to assume a curve shape model, fit it to a\n",
    "few data points and differentiate it analytically, it is also possible to use simple median filtering or RANSAC for additional elimation of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often done in previous work to use multiple experimental setups with separate body parts (going up the chain) while fixating the rest of the body to improve the estimation accuracy. For the iCub, the arms were \"cut\" at the position of the 6 DOF F/T sensors so that the measurement gives the contact forces for a fixed base scenario. The limbs should move with a standardized trajectory excitation that highlights all the influencing columns and has sufficient velocities, accelerations and forces appearing. The dynamic equations don't include friction or other non-linear effects. We can get the Jacobian(s) from iDynTree.\n",

This way it is supposedly easier to get time series measurements, averaging can be done, noise can be estimated and velocities and accelerations can be calculated analytically using the FFT to get near noise-free values. The joint angles for the $i$-th of $n$ joints are given by $N$ coefficients:\n",
