    "## Identification\n",
    "\n",
    "We're looking to find the (standard) parameter vector $x$ (mass, com, inertia for each joint) in the inverse dynamics regressor equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "iDynTree can calculate the dynamics regressor $Y$ numerically (using RNEA) for each state, which is dependent on the joint-link tree and on the system state ($q, \\dot{q}, \\ddot{q}$). For Walk-Man, the contact forces with the ground at the feet can be measured. For fixed base dynamics, the only force is coming through the constrained base link (for which the Jacobian is $J = [I \\quad 0]$ and the contact forces vanish).\n",
    "Robotran or openSYMORO gives the regressor as symbolic equations that are dependent on the system state and the dynamical and some structural parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "When torques and/or contact forces are known and Y is retrieved through iDynTree (also $J^T$ of each contact link), we can calculate \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Yx = \\tau - \\sum_{l \\in L} J_{l}^T f_l^{ext} $$\n",
    "$$ x = Y^{-1}\\tau - Y^{-1}\\sum_{l \\in L} J_{l}^T f_l^{ext} $$\n",
    "(using pseudoinverse instead of real inverse)\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{x} = Y^{+}\\tau - Y^{+}\\sum_{l \\in L} J_{l}^T f_l^{ext} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Y is only dependent on motion data and model, and can be calculated without knowing x)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do identification of $x$ without having to know the contact forces, the HyQ identification code uses a null-space multiplication to eliminate the contact forces (they don't have sensors in the feet).\n",
    " \n",
    "$$ Yx = \\tau - J^T f_\\text{ext} $$\n",
    "$$ N(J^T)Yx = N(J^T)\\tau - \\underbrace{N(J^T)J^T f_\\text{ext}}_{=0}$$\n",
    "$$ x = [N(J^T)Y]^{-1}N(J^T)\\tau $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If only contact forces are known, there is also the possibility to just look at the upper equations of the matrix formulation and leave out the joint torques (see: Ayusawa, Venture: \"Identifiability and identification of inertial parameters using the underactuated base-link dynamics for legged multibody systems\").\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard and Base Parameters\n",
    "The parameters $x$ are called the standard parameters as they occur in the normal dynamics equations. The rank of the regressor is usually smaller than its number of columns, i.e. some columns are linearly dependent (not of full rank). There are therefore infinite solutions for the equations of which only some are physically consistent and meaningful (see below).\n",
    "Therefore, before doing the inversion and to retrieve the identifiable base parameters, we need to reduce the regressor $Y$'s columns to the linearly independent one, using an algorithm given by Gautier, 1990, using SVD or QR or using closed form rules (Khalil). That way, some base parameters will be linear combinations of two or more standard parameters, that were linearly dependent. The base parameters are linearly independent but the choice is not unique (of course there are multiple possibilities of combining the columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "If $Y$ is not of full rank (i.e. columns not reduced), a damped least-squares method is recommended by Siciliano, et al (p.282). There is computeFloatingBaseIdentifiableSubspace() in iDynTree which calculates the orthogonal basis $B$ of the base parameter subspace. It can be used to project from the standard regressor to the base regressor, i.e. $Y_\\text{base} = Y_\\text{std}B$ (See Traversaro, 2015, p.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinary least squares can be improved by weighting with the inverse of the standard deviation of the error calculated with the ordinary LS (Gautier, 2013, p.1431).\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the base parameters $\\tilde{x}$, we need to project them back to the standard basis in order to use them for e.g. simulation models or modifying the URDF file. When using a symbolic regressor, both can stay in the base subspace for e.g. torque prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the transpose of $B$ (transpose is here equal to pseudoinverse because the columns are already linearly independent), we can calculate $x_\\text{std} = B^T x_\\text{base}$.\n",
    "This way, a mean estimation is produced to get the unknown distribution of the linear combinations back to multiple single parameters. In any case, those are the columns that ideally don't have an impact to the result anyway (or a very small one), so the distribution shouldn't matter much.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Essential Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The base parameters might still have elements that are almost zero and therefore don't contribute to the dynamics. Possibly because they have not been excited in the experiment that was measured. They don't contribute to the calculations. They can therefore be cancelled to retrieve a smaller set of parameters called the essential parameters in order to simplify the model further.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential parameters can be determined using the relative standard deviation. (See Gautier, 2013,p.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard parameters are physical consistent if masses are positive, the inertia matrix is positive definite and the center of mass is located inside of the segment. The moments of inertia need to respect the triangle inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Identification of difference between a priori parameters and identified ones\n",
    "\n",
    "Using parameters from the CAD model, it is possible to determine physical consistent standard parameters that are close to the a priori knowledge (Gautier, 2013, p.1432).\n",
    "Let $x^\\text{ref}_\\text{std}$ be the a priori CAD parameter vector and $\\tau^\\text{ref}$ be the torques estimated with these parameters by $\\tau^\\text{ref} = Y_\\text{std}x^\\text{ref}_\\text{std}$.\n",
    "Subtracting the regressor equation of the identification problem from the estimated parameters, we get:\n",
    "$$\\tau - \\tau^\\text{ref} = Y_\\text{std} (x_\\text{std} - x^\\text{ref}_\\text{std}) + \\rho $$\n",
    "$$ \\iff \\Delta \\tau = Y_\\text{std} \\Delta x_\\text{std} + \\rho $$"

    "## Retrieving torque measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The torque measurements should measure the deflection between link $i$ and child link $i+1$. For the position, velocity and acceleration, it is likely necessary to differentiate the velocity and possibly also the position depending on what measurements are available. Since differentiation has the effect of high-pass filtering and therefore adding new noise, the data can be low-pass filtered (e.g. with an appropriately designed butterworth filter). This however can introduce phase-shift. Another option is to assume a curve shape model, fit it to a\n",
    "few data points and differentiate it analytically, it is also possible to use simple median filtering or RANSAC for additional elimation of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often done in previous work to use multiple experimental setups with separate body parts (going up the chain) while fixating the rest of the body to improve the estimation accuracy. For the iCub, the arms were \"cut\" at the position of the 6 DOF F/T sensors so that the measurement gives the contact forces for a fixed base scenario. The limbs should move with a standardized trajectory excitation that highlights all the influencing columns and has sufficient velocities, accelerations and forces appearing. The dynamic equations don't include friction or other non-linear effects. We can get the Jacobian(s) from iDynTree.\n",

    "In order to get meaningful sample data that allows good estimation, trajectories can be generated by optimization.\n",
    "Swevers, Gensemann (1997) describe using Fourier series for all joints to get periodic excitation and using a common pulsation (i.e. frequency) so the excitation as a whole also stays periodic. This way it is supposedly easier to get time series measurements, averaging can be done, noise can be estimated and velocities and accelerations can be calculated analytically using the FFT to get near noise-free values. The joint angles for the $i$-th of $n$ joints are given by $N$ coefficients:\n",
