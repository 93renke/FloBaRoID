The $\\pi$ vector is a $10 \\cdot \\text{nrOfLinks}$ inertial parameters vector, such that the elements of the vector from the $((i-1) \\cdot 10)$-th to the $((i \\cdot 10) - 1))$-th belong to the i-th link. For more details on the inertial parameters vector, check https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01137215/document\".\n",
    "\n",
    "iDynTree can calculate the dynamics regressor $Y$, which is dependent on the joint-link tree and on the system state ($q, \\dot{q}, \\ddot{q}$). For Walk-Man, the contact forces with the ground at the feet can be measured. For fixed base dynamics, the only force is coming through the constrained base link (for which the Jacobian is $J = [I \\quad 0]$ and the contact forces vanish).\n",
    "\n",
    "When torques and/or contact forces are known and Y is retrieved through iDynTree (also $J^T$ of each contact link), we can calculate \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Yx = \\tau - \\sum_{l \\in L} J_{l}^T f_l^{ext} $$\n",

    "\n",
    "(Y is only dependent on motion data and model, and can be calculated without knowing x)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do identification of $x$ without having to know the contact forces, the HyQ identification code from Andrea and Guido uses a null-space multiplication to eliminate the contact forces (they don't have sensors in the feet).\n",
    " \n",

    "If only contact forces are known, there is also the possibility to just look at the upper equations of the matrix formulation and leave out the joint torques (see: Ayusawa, Venture: \"Identifiability and identification of inertial parameters using the underactuated base-link dynamics for legged multibody systems\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Before doing the inversion, we need to reduce the standard parameters to the actually identifiable base parameters by reducing $Y$ to the linearly independent columns, e.g. using Gautier algorithm, SVD or QR. Otherwise the pseudoinverse least squares approximation can be inaccurate and $x$ can include negative values ($Y_\\text{base}$ still has the same amount of rows afterwards). Also if $Y$ is not of full rank (i.e. columns not reduced), a damped least-squares method is recommended by Siciliano, et al (p.282). There is computeFloatingBaseIdentifiableSubspace in iDynTree, which should be preferred for consistency (it does expect the contact forces, where?). The resulting basis $B$ of the base parameter subspace can be used as a projection from the standard regressor to the base regressor, $ Y_\\text{base} = Y_\\text{std}B $.\n",
    "After obtaining the base parameters, we need to project them back to the standard basis in order to use them for e.g. simulation models.\n",
    "Using the transpose of $B$ (transpose is here supposedly equal to pseudoinverse because the columns are already linearly independent), we can calculate $x_\\text{std} = B x_\\text{base}$.\n",
    "This way, we will generate an estimation of mean values to get the unknown distribution of one column to multiple ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The inversion assumes that all the parameters are linear in the equations. This is only true for Newton-Euler if the inertia tensors are formed about the link frames not the COM frames (iDynTree seems to do exactly that, but check).

    "## Retrieving torque measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often done in previous work to use multiple experimental setups with separate body parts (going up the chain) while fixating the rest of the body to improve the estimation accuracy. For the iCub, the arms were \"cut\" at the position of the 6 DOF F/T sensors so that the measurement gives the contact forces for a fixed base scenario. The limbs should move with a standardized trajectory excitation that highlights all the influencing columns and has sufficient velocities, accelerations and forces appearing. The dynamic equations don't include friction or other non-linear effects. We can get the Jacobian(s) from iDynTree.\n",

    "A good estimation has physically consistent parameters (positive definite inertia values, respect the triangle inequality) and small errors between measured torques and simulated torques with newly estimated parameters, possibly limited to only a certain task.

    "Swevers, Gensemann (1997) describe using Fourier series for all joints to get periodic excitation and using a common pulsation (i.e. frequency) so the excitation as a whole also stays periodic. This way it is supposedly easier to get time series measurements, averaging can be done, noise can be estimated and velocities and accelerations can be calculated analytically using the FFT to get near noise-free values. The joint angles for the $i$-th of $n$ joints are given by $N$ coefficients:\n",
