    "## Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard and Base Parameters\n",
    "The parameters $x$ are called the standard parameters as they occur in the normal dynamics equations. The rank of the regressor is usually smaller than its number of columns, i.e. some columns are linearly dependent (matrix is rank deficient). There are therefore infinite solutions for the equations of which only some are physically consistent and meaningful (see below) because the matrix is singular.\n",
    "Before inverting the equation to retrieve the minimum identifiable parameters (base or identifiable parameters), we need to reduce the regressor $Y$'s columns to the linearly independent one, using an algorithm given by Gautier, 1990, using SVD or QR or using closed form rules (Khalil). That way, some base parameters that are not significant are removed and some will be linear combinations of two or more standard parameters, that were linearly dependent. The base parameters are linearly independent but the choice is not unique (there are multiple possibilities of combining the columns).\n",
    "\n",
    "The regressor for the base parameters can be retrieved from the SVD, where the first $\\text{rank}(Y_\\text{std})$ columns of V are the basis vectors of the identifiable subspace. There is computeFloatingBaseIdentifiableSubspace() in iDynTree which calculates this orthogonal basis $B$ of the identifiable parameters subspace. It can be used to project from the standard regressor to the base regressor, i.e. $Y_\\text{base} = Y_\\text{std}B$ (See Traversaro, 2015, p.3). Other methods include the QR decomposition or the SVD with a permutation matrix that explicitly defines which columns are changed and combined (See Gautier, 1990).\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordinary least squares can be improved by weighting with the inverse of the standard deviation of the error calculated with the ordinary LS (Gautier, 2013, p.1431).\n",
    "That way, parameters with smaller errors deviation are given higher priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "After obtaining the base parameters $\\tilde{x}$, they can be projected back to the standard basis in order to use them for e.g. simulation models or modifying the URDF file. When using a symbolic regressor, both can stay in the base subspace for e.g. torque prediction.\n",
    "This way, the parameters are however not necessarily physically meaningful (see physical consistency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the transpose of $B$ (here equal to inverse), we can calculate $x_\\text{std} = B^T x_\\text{base}$. This way, a mean estimation is produced to get the unknown distribution of the linear combinations back to multiple single parameters."

    "### Essential Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "The base parameters might still have elements that are (get identified as?) almost zero and therefore don't contribute much to the dynamics calculations. Possibly because they have not been excited well in the experiment that was measured. They can therefore be cancelled (set to zero or params/regressor columns deleted) to retrieve a smaller set of parameters called the essential parameters in order to simplify the model further. The estimation results will not exactly be the same as the model will be expressed with fewer parameters and equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential base parameters can be determined using the relative standard deviation of the identifed parameter vector, using standard deviation of the error of the estimated torques (See Gautier, 2013). Iteratively, the parameter with the largest relative std dev will be cancelled and the estimation repeated. This is done until a ratio of min and max relative std dev on the parameters is reached that is between 30 and 20. That way, the similarity of estimation \"certainty\" of the remaining parameters is increased. The error itself is not looked at.  Other criteria for stopping the model reduction because of error are the F-statistic (Janot 2014) or the lack-of-fit error (based on mean least squares) but these measures assume that the error is normal distributed which is not always the case. Janot recommends improving measurements, filtering etc. (feasible for us?). Also, it is unclear (to me) how these measures are related to amount of samples selected, they seem to change a lot on the same data but e.g. every other sample. \n",
    "Alternatively, looking at the error of the estimation in relation to the maximal torques range of each joint or the maximum measured torque ranges allow stopping before the prediction error gets too large (torque prediction should ultimately still be good, even if the parameters are not estimated close to the actual values).\n",
    "\n",
    "The torque error $\\rho$ in $(4)$ includes measurement error, error due to unmodelled effects (linear and non-linear) and the error from model reduction. Before reduction, only the modelling error $\\rho_j$ of sample $j$ can be determined (the real torques are not known) as the mean of the difference of measured torques $\\tau_i$ and the corresponding estimated torques $\\hat{\\tau_i}$ of joint $i$:\n",

    "The percentual error in regard to e.g. the maximum torque (range) is:\n",
    "$$ mse / mean(torqranges) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the QR decomposition or permutation matrices for determining which std parameters are regrouped into the base parameters, it is known which of the standard parameters belong to each of the base parameters. Having determined the indices of the essential parameters within the base parameters, and knowing the indices of the base parameters within the standard parameters, the essential parameters within the standard parameters can also be determined.\n",
    "Each base parameter $b$ can correspond to a linear combination of $n$ standard parameters $a_n$ $k_1a_1+k_2a_2+...+k_na_n$. Each of the $a_n$ is assumed to be essential if $b$ is essential (to be inclusive; some of them can have no influence).\n",

    "\n",
    "Standard parameters are called physical consistent if masses are positive, the inertia matrix is positive definite and the center of mass is located inside of the segment. The moments of inertia need to respect the triangle inequality.\n",
    "The base (and base essential parameters) are usually not consistent, because they are only derived to minimize the error norm of the torque prediction.\n",

    "It is shown that additionally using the information from the reference parameters about which parameters are essential and weighing the regressor and parameter vectors with it, the optimal consistent parameters are found.\n",

    "\n",
    "The torque measurements should measure the deflection between link $i$ and child link $i+1$. For the position, velocity and acceleration, it is likely necessary to differentiate the velocity and possibly also the position depending on what measurements are available. Since differentiation has the effect of high-pass filtering and therefore adding new noise, the data can be low-pass filtered (e.g. with an appropriately designed butterworth filter). Even with butterworth, this can introduce phase-shift. Another option is to assume a curve shape model,\n",

For the iCub, the arms were \"cut\" at the position of the 6 DOF F/T sensors so that the measurement gives the contact forces for a fixed base scenario. The limbs should move with a standardized trajectory excitation that highlights all the influencing columns and has sufficient velocities, accelerations and forces appearing.

    "Swevers, Gensemann (1997) use Fourier series on all joints to generate periodic excitation and use a common pulsation (i.e. frequency) so the excitation as a whole also stays periodic (multiples of the base frequency?). This way it is said to be easier to get time series measurements because averaging can be done to reduce noise, noise can be estimated and velocities and accelerations can be calculated analytically using the FFT to get near noise-free values. The joint angles for the $i$-th of $n$ joints are given by $N$ coefficients:\n",

Optimization takes the model constraints into account, too.\n",
    "\n",

Using the essential parameter approach, this results in only the most likely parameters being changed from the a priori values that are relevant for this task.\n",
