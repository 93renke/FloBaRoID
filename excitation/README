Generate trajectories / excitations for Walk-Man

Includes a yarp module that has to be built and started:

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ../
make

(have 'gazebo' and 'yarpserver --write' running)
./excitation

using $ yarp write ... /excitation/switch:i
>> start

start the control thread.

Then, using $ yarp write ... /excitation/command:i
it is then possible to manually set arm positions, e.g. by writing
(set_left_arm -50 40 40 -30 20 10 10) 0

To generate excitation trajectories, run excite.py <filename>

This will read the resulting joint torques measurements and write to a file measurements.npy
